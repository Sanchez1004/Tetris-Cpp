**TETRIS GAME MADE USING C++ AND RAYLIB 4.5.0**
-

This is a simple tetris game that uses the RAYLIB framework for GUI
and can be used as a template for some users that are starting in game development,
this is a good option to understand how a game works, what are those basic
things that a game needs, sounds, music, interaction, communication between
the different parts of the game and this stuff that makes the game works, it's also
a good option to understand how to install packages and dependencies in a project.


**CONFIGURATION**

Configured with a CMakeLists file that handles the dependencies from the game,
there are two options to compile it, use VCPKG to install the dependencies or install RAYLIB framework
and configured the CMakeLists paths to the directory where the framework was installed.
